Hello! We are a team of data enthusiasts from Digi-Prodigy, and we’re excited to present our project: the Sales Cockpit.
Our goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable dashboards that empower decision-making and improve business outcomes.

*Sales Cockpit Dashboard Description

*Data Ingestion:

  The dashboard was created in Databricks using Salesforce data exported as CSV files. These files were ingested into Databricks, where we used SQL for data cleaning.

*Situation:

  The sales organization relies on a team of sales representatives to manage opportunities through various deal stages. However, tracking their performance, engagement 
  levels, and pipeline health was challenging due to the dispersed nature of data across Salesforce.To empower the sales reps and leadership with timely insights, a 
  centralized Sales Cockpit Dashboard was needed to transform raw Salesforce data into actionable intelligence.

*Task:

  Create a comprehensive, data-driven dashboard that allows the sales leadership to:
  
    1.Track pipeline and deal performance.
    
    2.Identify at-risk or inactive opportunities.
    
    3.Analyze forecast projections.
    
   Prioritize top deals and maximize win rates.
   
*Action:

  A Sales Cockpit Dashboard was developed with the following visual and analytical components:
  
1. Pipeline Insights:
   
    1.Weighted Pipeline Amount
     
    2.Total Pipeline Value
    
    3.Pipeline Opportunities
    
    4.Win Rate
    
    5.Average Deal Size
    
    6.Average Sales Cycle


2. Opportunity Risk Indicators:
   
    1.Without Amount:All opportunities have a value assigned.
    
    2.Without MEDDIC:Deals missing key qualification criteria.
    
    3.Without Activity:All opportunities lack recent activity.
    
    4.Without Next Step: No next steps logged.
    
    5.Expired: Deals past their due period.
    
    6.Stagnant: Deals showing inactivity.
    
    7.Lost Deals: Deals Lost.

3. Current Quarter:
   
   Displays deal stages (1 to 5) with opportunity count and value.

4. Forecast (Center Bottom Left):
   
    1.Commit
    
    2.Pipeline
    
    3.Upside

5. Future Quarters Outlook:
    
  The pipeline is heavily concentrated in Stages 1 and 2 across future quarters, highlighting strong potential but also a need for deal progression and nurturing. The 
  absence of Stage 5 deals may point to a longer sales cycle or stalled opportunities. Sales leaders should strategically allocate resources to advance early-stage deals 
  and prevent stagnation.

6. Top Deals Table (Bottom Center):
    
  Lists top 10 opportunities with:
  
    1.Stage
    
    2.MEDDIC score
    
    3.Age (days)
    
    4.Last Activity (days)

*Insights:
  1.Pipeline Insights
  
    High average sales cycle (130 days) suggests a need to shorten sales processes for better velocity.

    Strong total pipeline value indicates healthy lead generation.

  2.Current Quarter Pipeline
  
    Stage 3-to-5 transitions need more enablement or customer engagement.

    Healthy stage 1 bar shows strong top-of-bar activity.

  3.Forecast View
  
    Large gap between total pipeline and commit points to a need for better deal validation.

    Upside offers room for growth if engagement and progression improve.

  4.Future Quarters Outlook
  
    Heavy early-stage concentration suggests deals are not maturing fast enough.

    Early identification allows time to course-correct and move deals forward now.

  5.Top Deals Table

    Multiple top deals are over 200 days old with little to no recent activity—these require urgent follow-up.

    MEDDIC scores are relatively strong, indicating qualification efforts are in place for key deals.

*Result:

  1.Improved Visibility: Stakeholders gain a clear, real-time view of pipeline health and performance.
  
  2.Risk Mitigation: The dashboard identifies 191 opportunities without activity or next steps, allowing sales managers to take corrective action.
  
  3.Performance Optimization: Metrics like win rate (56%) and sales cycle (130 days) offer baselines for process improvement.
  
  4.Deal Prioritization: Helps focus on high-value, high-MEDDIC-scoring opportunities to increase closure rates.
  
  
*Dashboard Users:

  1.Sales Leadership (VPs, Directors)
  
  2.Sales Managers
  
  3.Sales Repsentaives
  
  4.Revenue Operations 

*Conclusion:
  1.To wrap up Sales Cockpit is more than just a dashboard.
  
  2.It’s a strategic tool that transforms raw opportunity data into insights, action, and outcomes
  .
  3.Built for performance-driven teams, it empowers everyone to make decisions, manage risk, and drive revenue growth.
  
  4.Thank you for reading.
