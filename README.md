Hello! We are a team of data enthusiasts from Digi-Prodigy, and we’re excited to present our project: the Sales Cockpit.
Our goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable dashboards that empower decision-making and improve business outcomes.

*Data Ingestion
  The dashboard was created in Databricks using Salesforce data exported as CSV files. These files were ingested into Databricks, where we used SQL for data cleaning.
*Sales Cockpit Dashboard Description

*Situation
  The sales organization relies on a team of sales representatives to manage opportunities through various deal stages. However, tracking their performance, engagement 
  levels, and pipeline health was challenging due to the dispersed nature of data across Salesforce.To empower the sales reps and leadership with timely insights, a 
  centralized Sales Cockpit Dashboard was needed to transform raw Salesforce data into actionable intelligence.

*Task
  Create a comprehensive, data-driven dashboard that allows the sales leadership to:
    1.Track pipeline and deal performance.
    2.Identify at-risk or inactive opportunities.
    3.Analyze forecast projections.
   Prioritize top deals and maximize win rates.
   
*Action
  A Sales Cockpit Dashboard was developed with the following visual and analytical components:
  
1. Pipeline Insights 
  Weighted Pipeline Amount
  Total Pipeline Value
  Pipeline Opportunities
  Win Rate
  Average Deal Size
  Average Sales Cycle


2. Opportunity Risk Indicators
  Without Amount:All opportunities have a value assigned.
  Without MEDDIC:Deals missing key qualification criteria.
  Without Activity:All opportunities lack recent activity.
  Without Next Step: No next steps logged.
  Expired: Deals past their due period.
  Stagnant: Deals showing inactivity.
  Lost Deals: Deals Lost.

4. Current Quarter 
  Displays deal stages (1 to 5) with opportunity count and value.

5. Forecast (Center Bottom Left)
  Commit
  Pipeline
  Upside

6. Future Quarters Outlook 
  The pipeline is heavily concentrated in Stages 1 and 2 across future quarters, highlighting strong potential but also a need for deal progression and nurturing. The 
  absence of Stage 5 deals may point to a longer sales cycle or stalled opportunities. Sales leaders should strategically allocate resources to advance early-stage deals and 
  prevent stagnation.

7. Top Deals Table (Bottom Center)
  Lists top 10 opportunities with:
  Stage
  MEDDIC score
  Age (days)
  Last Activity (days)
Highlights red flags such as long deal age or no recent follow-up 

*Result
  Improved Visibility: Stakeholders gain a clear, real-time view of pipeline health and performance.
  Risk Mitigation: The dashboard identifies 191 opportunities without activity or next steps, allowing sales managers to take corrective action.
  Performance Optimization: Metrics like win rate (56%) and sales cycle (130 days) offer baselines for process improvement.
  Deal Prioritization: Helps focus on high-value, high-MEDDIC-scoring opportunities to increase closure rates.

*Conclusion
  To wrap up Sales Cockpit is more than just a dashboard.
  It’s a strategic tool that transforms raw opportunity data into insights, action, and outcomes.
  Built for performance-driven teams, it empowers everyone to make decisions, manage risk, and drive revenue growth.
  Thank you for reading.
